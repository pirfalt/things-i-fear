> There are technologies which I'm worried that I will never understand. Let's admit that and then go through a few of them.

## Description

I would like to think that my technology preferences is based on objective reasons.

While trying to motivate some of my reasoning I noticed that my arguments were anything but objective. Instead I figured out that my reasoning is mostly fear/worry based, rather than objective. Let's talk about _that_, with a few different technologies as examples.

### Understandability matters

Sometimes I type guesses and hope for the best when evaluating the guess.
Without any _expected_ result.

... I _hate_ when that happens.

#### Previous experience also matters

But only because you may already understand it.

### Where does this come from?

"How did _this_ end up here?"

- CSS
  - HTML - selector matching
- Spring
  - @Annotations
  - "Externalized Configuration"
    https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config
  - "Profiles"
    https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.profiles
- Spring + Maven
  - Not all dependencies are downloaded before startup
- Class hierarchies

### Mental overload?

"Denial Of Service attack on your understandability."

- npm
- Maven

### Constant vigilance required

- Manual memory management
  - Sockets
  - Files
- `null`
- Languages in languages
  - json in yaml
  - html in js
  - go in python

### "Helpful frameworks"

- Vue (proxies)
- Svelt (compilers)
- React ("re-render everything")

### Counter examples

- SQL
  - Horrible syntax, but mostly understandable
- ORMs (Object Relational Mappers)
